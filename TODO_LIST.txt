TODO LIST

- Plays broken down by possession, but need to end the play on an offensive rebound or the ball goes out of bounds
- Eliminate any plays shorter than 2 seconds
- Determine when the play starts (i.e. one second after all five guys cross half court or something like that)
- Build classifier than segments the court and determines what percentage of the play someone is in that spot
- NOT NECCESARY: Identify skips in the data, handle accordingly


Strategies:
- snapshot at beginning of play
- look at when players get 'close' to one another



Plan of Attack:

- Extract the min distances of players within a threshold and include: time within that distance, the min distance, the x and y of the players (take the midpoint between the two players), and the time after the start of the play


First Implementation:

-> Segment the court into quadrants
-> Two sets of features, number of close encounters with the ball and number of close encounters without the ball for a given region

*** On closeness algorithm, sometimes it jumps slightly if a player goes outside the min distance and comes back in
